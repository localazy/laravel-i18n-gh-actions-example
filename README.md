![How to localize Laravel app with using Localazy and GitHub Actions](//TODO: add image)

This is an example repository showing how to use Localazy with Laravel and GitHub Actions for localization management.
To learn more, check out the [blog post](//TODO: add link) describing the set up in detail.

## Testing out this repo

This repository contains translations from an actual [Localize Laravel Application example](//TODO: add app link) app. You can try to run `localazy download` to see how it works. However, this app is in read-only mode, meaning that `localazy upload` will fail.

To run the application run the following command from project root folder

```shell
./vendor/bin/sail up
```

## Adjusting for your own project
